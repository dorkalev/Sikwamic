Sikwamic: Simple Key-Value With Commet
--------------------------------------

What is it good for?
--------------------
You can use REDIS straight from HTTP with long polling on GETs, commet style. This is very useful for development of web-realtime apps like web-chat

* Uses RACK - http://github.com/chneukirchen/rack
* Uses REDIS - http://github.com/antirez/redis

How to run?
-----------
make sure you have Rack and Redis installed and run:

ruby sikwamic.rb

How to use?
-----------

1. Write a value through:
http://localhost:9291/set/KEY/VALUE  (http://localhost:9291/set/user_55_name/john)
output: john

2. Read a value through:
http://localhost:9291/get/KEY  (http://localhost:9291/get/user_55_name)
output: john

3. Commetly read a value through: *
http://localhost:9291/get/KEY/OLDVALUE
This action opens a connection to the server and returns the value of the KEY only once the VALUE is different than inputed

if "user_55_name" value is "john" 

then...
http://localhost:9291/get_if_modified/user_55_name/john)
output: john
response: 5 seconds

and...
http://localhost:9291/get_if_modified/user_55_name/jeff
output: john
response: immediate

You can use Sikwamic inside infrastructure of realtime webchat and for SIMPLE online key-value over HTTP activities (over AJAX)

Enjoy ;-)
